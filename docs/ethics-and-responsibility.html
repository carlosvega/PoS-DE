<p>Very often, progress, ethics and laws go hand in hand. The industrial revolution increased the living standards but also brought new challenges, problems and ethical questions. Labour conditions were harsh, and child labour was common long before the industrial revolution. Progress and technology raise new ethical questions. Bit by bit certain practices and conditions became culturally unacceptable. Then a growing social consensus in the same direction eventually forced laws to reflect those changes. Nowadays, working rights such as office restrooms or the lunch break are widespread.</p>

<p>Similarly, we live in the information revolution, which has transformed the way societies communicate in a way not seen since the Gutenberg printer revolution, enabling the world to transmit information worldwide almost instantaneously through the interconnection of computers. The information era brings ethical challenges to a new dimension. Gutenberg’s print helped to spread literature and knowledge, but it also made it easier to spread hate and fake news (see <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/fake-news-history-long-violent-214535/">this article for some examples</a>). Today, tools like Facebook have been used to incite the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html">genocide of Rohingya in Myanmar</a>. Every data scientist must understand the impact of their work for the good and the bad. Something as simple as a good visualization can be enlightening and convince people to get a vaccine or find the root of an outbreak (see the map of John Snow). But bad data science can have unexpected real-world consequences too.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will not address all the philosophical questions regarding ethics, which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics">lengthy</a> but will try to focus on the ethical practice of data science. Many ethical questions affecting data ethics have already been tackled during this book. Such questions have been interleaved during this book together with other topics, e.g., algorithmic fairness, validity issues and their consequences. Therefore, this book provides a utilitarian framework of ethics. This chapter describes how ethical values, regardless of which they may be, affect the practice of data science, either because of the lack of commitment to them or to how data science is conditioned when abiding by them.</p>

<p>Ethics comes from the Greek word <em>Ethos</em>, meaning habit or custom. Ethics are theories that offer normatively valid reasons to rationally endorsing a code of behaviour. In general, the cost of following an ethical rule is less than the benefit we obtain from others following the same rule (e.g. “not stealing does not require an effort from myself, and I get a huge benefit from others following the same rule”). In this sense, like many other social phenomena, ethical rules can be regarded as a network which follows Metcalfe’s Law, which implies a critical mass point in network size, after which network value begins to exceed its cost <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-metcalfe2013metcalfe" role="doc-biblioref">Metcalfe 2013</a>)</span>.This behaviour explains why ethical or societal changes may often be adopted very quickly after a long <em>plateau</em>. However, this may happen in both ways, either after reaching certain mass point or receding from it. For example, feminist ethics aims to understand, criticise and correct how gender operates within our moral beliefs and practices <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sep-feminism-ethics" role="doc-biblioref">Norlock 2019</a>)</span>. Similarly, we can find environmental ethics and, of course, data ethics. In science, we often need to answer ethical questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it right to use RCT in this specific scenario?</li>
<li>Under what conditions is justified to conduct animal experiments?</li>
</ul>
<p>All ethics groups aim to understand, criticise and correct how certain actions impact a particular sphere. Similarly, <strong>data ethics aim to understand, criticise and correct how our data practices (from collection, to processing, analysis) operate within our moral beliefs and impact our society</strong>.</p>
<p>Descriptively, <em>morality</em> refers to a code of conduct that is put forward by a society or group (e.g. a religion), or accepted by an individual. In a normative sense, <em>morality</em> refers to a code of conduct that would be accepted by anyone who meets certain intellectual conditions (e.g. being rational) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sep-morality-definition" role="doc-biblioref">Gert and Gert 2020</a>)</span>. For example, a company is not a <em>moral agent</em> but it can encourage a certain <em>code of conduct</em> to their workers. Even though <em>morality</em> is the subject matter of ethics, it is most often used interchangeably with <em>ethics</em>. Finally, ethics are not laws but laws are often used to enforce certain shared social values.</p>
<p>In essence, ethics tell us about what is right and wrong. They are the cornerstone of civilisation and no human practice is foreign to ethical values, although these may vary from region to region or over time. For many, their moral principles stem from religious teachings, ideologies, philosophies, etc. These can promote ethical behaviour, but it does not mean that ethics should necessarily stem from a religion or belong to a particular ideology or philosophy.</p>
<p>Finally, ethics are not laws but very often laws reflect the societal ethical consensus. Progress brings new ethical questions, resulting in a changing societal consensus that eventually translates into new laws. A notable example is the advent of the industrial era which radically reshaped the working methods. Workers fought to claim certain rights (e.g. have a place to have lunch, time to have lunch, toilets, etc.). However, ethical changes may not always imply <em>replacing</em> a set of rules by another set, or <em>replacing</em> a code of conduct for another code of conduct. Back then when western countries forbid women from showing their bare legs, many women defended their right to wear whatever clothes they wanted and as short as they wanted. Clothes like the mini-skirt became a symbol because it challenged the established code of conduct. In the same way, trousers also were a symbol for women empowerment in the 1850s (see bloomers), also to show that they could also be part of the workforce. Nevertheless, <strong>what is important about this</strong> kind of changes is not that they were replacing their clothes for another set of clothes. They wanted to have the choice, to have control over their clothes. All in all, just because people could wear whatever they wanted it does not mean that they will wear it. But people now have the choice.</p>
<p>Exactly the same can be applied to data science in many scenarios. The most notable case affects browsing the internet and the recent regulations for cookies. Thanks to the new regulations, any website you browse should give you the choice to either accept analytics cookies or not. <strong>Data ethics is about having control as data subjects over your data</strong>. You have the choice to withdraw from a study or remove your data from Facebook or Twitter. <strong>Data ethics extend your rights and those from which you may collect data</strong>.</p>

<div id="ethical-frameworks" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="5.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Ethical Frameworks<a href="ethics-and-responsibility.html#ethical-frameworks" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In this book we will not delve into the different ethical frameworks. However, it is important to regard at least three of them superficially.</p>
<div id="consequentialism" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="5.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Consequentialism<a href="ethics-and-responsibility.html#consequentialism" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In a consequential ethical framework, our choices are morally assessed only by their consequences (e.g. utilitarians may evaluate their choices based on the obtained pleasure, happiness, welfare, safety). People may obtain pleasure or satisfaction from a car based on different attributes. Speed may satisfy your need to arrive earlier to your destination. Public transport may be preferred in terms of safety or pollution. Similarly, there are consequences to consider in science and data science. Is your computer program faster although it requires 100 computers?</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to trade off such consequences and for example trade off speed in exchange of a less costly solution (using 100 computers needs a lot of energy). Thus, science also deals with epistemic consequences, such as whether the model predictions are precise or accurate; or if the explanations of our scientific theories are successful. Other actions may affect institutions. If the scientific method and the appropriate means are not properly followed, errors may happen, damaging the trust of an institution, the impartiality of a jury, and so on.</p>
<p>The consequentialism framework is not exempt from issues. Consequentialism is very demanding since all acts are either required or forbidden because every choice has consequences. Importantly, consequences are not always clear and evident. For instance, sharing my medical records may improve general health care at the cost of losing my individual privacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="deontology" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="5.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Deontology<a href="ethics-and-responsibility.html#deontology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Act as if the maxim of your action should become, by your will, the universal law of nature.” — Categorical Imperative of Immanuel Kant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For deontology, to choose morally is to satisfy relevant rules and duties. Deontology comes from the greek word <em>deon</em> (duty). Under this framework, some choices are not justified because of their effects. People’s rights are a good example (e.g. right to demonstrate, expression).</p>
<p>Some examples include the journalist deontology code which considers the right of people not to answer a question. Nurses have a deontology code under which they are required to obtain consent from the patient or its relatives. Note that the actions of a nursing team could have beneficial consequences for the patient but they need to wait for the consent. Of course, deontology codes always provide exceptions (e.g. an unconscious person in the sidewalk must be helped).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some choices cannot be justified by their effects, no matter how good their consequences are, some choices are forbidden and others mandated.” — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sep-ethics-deontological" role="doc-biblioref">Alexander and Moore 2021</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advantages of deontology over consequentialism lie in the ability to create checklists and conduct codes without the need to consider all consequences. Some examples of such checklists exist in data science.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.go-fair.org/">FAIR</a>: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wilkinson2016fair" role="doc-biblioref">Wilkinson et al. 2016</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>DOME: recommendations for supervised machine learning validation in biology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-walsh2021dome" role="doc-biblioref">Walsh et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deontology issues relate to the blind compliance with deontological norms, which may bring disastrous consequences. This problem may lead to deontology fundamentalism that forbids questioning the rules. Categorical rules may lack degrees of wrongness.</p>
<p>There have been various attempts to reconcile deontology with consequentialism. The proposed “threshold deontology” indicates that rules must govern up to a certain point regardless of the adverse consequences. But once the consequences become so dire that they cross a stipulated threshold, consequentialism takes over.</p>
</div>
<div id="virtues" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="5.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.3</span> Virtues<a href="ethics-and-responsibility.html#virtues" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, we have virtue ethics. Defenders of this view argue that morality consists of having proper character traits, i.e. virtues, and to exemplify them through their use. Some argue that certain traits define humans, what we usually refer as humanity (hospitality, etc.). Philosophers like Aristotle argued that there are some traits that distinguishes us as humans (e.g. compassion, help, generosity).</p>
<p>In science, there are many virtues that we need to consider every day. Scientists need to defend their colleagues or find the courage to criticise them. Scientists need to be honest and sincere. The problem, as can be seen, is that virtue ethics is less demanding than a defined set of rules or codes of conduct. Virtues do not state any set of rules or quantities regarding the amount of your honesty or help. However, virtues are usually accompanied by justifications from a moral perspective. For instance, “I do help because I believe helping is good”.</p>
<p>Importantly, deontology codes are better understood when they are properly justified. However, many prescriptions from deontology codes cannot be justified by virtues right away. For instance, helping is a strong virtue, but providing treatment without consent is not acceptable. Moral conflicts can be difficult to solve by reference to virtues alone. These conflicts are common in science and data science, e.g., should we employ animals for research?.</p>

<div id="values-in-science" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="5.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Values in Science<a href="ethics-and-responsibility.html#values-in-science" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“One cannot deduce an ‘ought’ from an ‘is’” — David Hume</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his book “Philosophy of Science for Scientists” (Springer), Lars-Göran Johansson dedicates the 13th Chapter to discuss the role of values in science and to different views regarding the meaning of value-free science. I would like to superficially tackle this topic as I believe it to impact data science as it does for general science. As Johansson argues, a strong interpretation of value-free science would not contain any expression of values. However, as the author points out, this view ignores potential effects on some groups <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-johansson2016philosophy" role="doc-biblioref">Johansson et al. 2016</a>)</span>. For instance, such a view of data science would perhaps ignore fairness values, hence ignoring an appropriate data collection, including a diversity of individuals or a proper evaluation of the outcome performance (either of an analysis or a model) on different groups. Another alternative, perhaps more reasonable, is that researchers should not convey their values. However, a researcher could provide an accurate description of the effects of some measures and yet recommend a particular action based on its subjective analysis of the analysed effects. It is then up to the reader to distinguish between the first part and the prescription.</p>
<p>A third interpretation, the author adds, is that “one ought not to deduce value statements from premises that only contain descriptive statements” (see Hume’s quote). However, very often, political argumentation breaks this rule, usually by jumping from descriptive statements to normative statements while leaving out (sometimes deliberately) an intermediate premise. This last issue stems from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem">is-ought problem</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact%E2%80%93value_distinction">fact-value distinction</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#io">interpretation debate</a> of Hume’s words <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sep-hume-moral" role="doc-biblioref">Cohon 2018</a>)</span>, it is never easy not to deduce normative conclusions from descriptive statements, specially in fields such as psychology, economics or political science. And very often, words such as prosperity, democracy are used to describe, but they are nonetheless normatively charged words. The important conclusion is to explicitly indicate the norm and definitions of such terms in our research, specially considering that definitions and norms may evolve over time.</p>
<p>Consider the following quotes regarding value-free and value-laden science.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everybody would agree that scientific knowledge has sometimes been used for unethical ends — to make nuclear and chemical weapons, for example. But such cases do not show that there is something ethically objectionable about scientific knowledge itself. It is the <em>use</em> to which that knowledge is put that is unethical. Indeed many philosophers would say that it makes no sense to talk about science or scientific knowledge being ethical or unethical per se. For science is concerned with facts, and facts in themselves have no ethical significance. It is what we do with those facts that is right or wrong, moral or immoral. On this view, science is essentially a <em>value-free</em> activity. — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-okasha-pos" role="doc-biblioref">Okasha 2016</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Research aimed at finding better treatment for diseases are certainly value-laden; we would give very high value to positive results in this area. But, of course, reports of such results, if they are found, should be value-free; we want objective knowledge about what to do for curing and/or preventing severe diseases. That is to say, scientific activity can be value-laden and value-free at the same time. — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-johansson2016philosophy" role="doc-biblioref">Johansson et al. 2016</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One takeaway message from this section is that science is driven by values. Science is, therefore, value-laden, but its results can, and should, be value-free. Whether a researcher comes to a conclusion that stands in line or that undermines the researcher’s non-scientific interests, one must, under all circumstances, evaluate the matter itself, as such considerations are not relevant arguments for or against the scientific work at issue.</p>
<p>A relevant example is the feminist critique of science <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sep-feminist-science" role="doc-biblioref">Crasnow 2020</a>)</span> and the existence of certain unconscious assumptions from which researchers might be unaware until recently. A notable example includes the research on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease_in_women#History">myocardial infarction</a>, which was mainly conducted on men. Today we understand symptoms vary between women and men. This issue resulted in underdiagnosis and mistreatment of infarction in women. Similarly, some assumptions derived from the modern state of society, were employed to describe social patterns in prehistory. For instance, the division of labour between sexes with men dedicated to outdoor activities and women dedicated to home activities has conditioned the research about prehistoric humans. Recent studies <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/prehistoric-female-hunter-discovery-upends-gender-role-assumptions">challenge the common assumption that prehistoric men hunted while women gathered</a>. The relevant conclusion is not whether the previous research is false but that unconscious norms regarding what we consider ‘normal’ may affect our criteria to focus on some circumstances and ignore others. What we consider ‘normal’ or ‘common’ may vary across regions and over time. All in all, humans are not neutral observers of the external world.</p>
<p>Sorting phenomena into categories is an interest-related task <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-johansson2016philosophy" role="doc-biblioref">Johansson et al. 2016</a>)</span> but is also unavoidable. Nevertheless, is important to make such interests explicit. An example of such categories defined by humans is diseases, which are progressively updated, hierarchized or redefined according to new knowledge. Diseases are not found in nature as entities per se; they refer to a definable deviation from a normal phenotype evident via symptoms and/or signs. The different sets of symptoms, pathologies and signs are grouped into diseases, and likewise diseases are grouped into categories, all of them organised into disease taxonomies (e.g. International Classification of Diseases). Thus, one disease can have more than one etiology, and one etiology can lead to more than one disease <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vega2021hume" role="doc-biblioref">Vega 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Note for data scientists!</strong></p>
</div>
<p>A <strong>descriptive statement</strong> gives an account of how the world is without stating whether that is good or bad. Thus, such statements describe in an objective or non-judgmental way. Conversely, a <strong>normative statement</strong> expresses an evaluation, stating that something is good or bad, better or worse, relative to some standard or alternative (i.e. norm).</p>

<p>Some events in history completely changed how we see the world. Section <a href="ethics-and-responsibility.html#ethic-examples">5.7</a> will present some of these events and how they relate to data ethics. However, the consequences of these events share common aspects. In the case of data ethics and science, some events have reshaped the societal consensus and the conception of certain rights. For instance, the scandals and ban of Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/11/magazine/what-the-world-needs-now-is-ddt.html">DTT</a>) as insecticide changed the cultural awareness regarding chemicals. In the USA, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study">Tuskegee tragedy</a> raised ethical questions regarding voluntary informed consent, which led to the establishment of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research">National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Research_Act">National Research Act</a>. Both were intended to shape bioethics policies in the USA and the establishment of institutional review boards for the studies.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/facial-recognition-s-dirty-little-secret-millions-online-photos-scraped-n981921">IBM faced an scandal</a> in 2019 regarding the scrapping of millions of on-line pictures without consent for the development of facial recognition technology. Also, in 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Nightingale">Project Nightingale</a>, was a data storage and processing project by Google and Ascension (one of the largest private healthcare systems in the United States), which involved the secret transfer of medical data of up to 50 million US Americans. The data was transferred without consent from doctors and patients containing full personal details, including name and medical history and could be accessed by Google staff (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/google-medical-data-project-nightingale-secret-transfer-us-health-information">The Guardian, 2019</a>). The raw data included lab results, diagnoses, hospital records such as medical history, and personal details of patients. In the 2010s, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> involved the unconsented personal data collection from millions of Facebook users by British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. This data was predominantly employed for political advertising. This event led to the development of the <code>#DeleteFacebook</code> movement, among other cultural and political consequences. The Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook with $5 billion. The cultural impact of these scandals was huge and led to massive media coverage, TV shows and films. Regulators and law makers also acted to further protect users data ownership.</p>
<p>In this sense, <strong>ethics are intended to be actionable</strong>. For instance, environmental ethics <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sep-ethics-environmental" role="doc-biblioref">Brennan and Lo 2022</a>)</span> make considerations about the moral relationship of human beings to the environment and its non-human contents, e.g., “is it morally acceptable to pollute a river for the production of energy?”. Once we answer such questions, actions need to <em>make a difference</em>, e.g., translating the answer into rules, laws or regulations to either allow, forbid or limit such practice. Answering ethical questions or showcasing a position to them is not enough. For example, if the societal consensus (either at a company level or country level) agrees on the need for toilets in the workplace (or kitchens), the next step is to provide such spaces to <em>make a change</em>.</p>
<p>However, it is not always clear how to articulate certain ethical positions. Consider the following ethical goal: “artificial intelligence models should be equally fair for everybody disregarding of their demographic characteristics”. Then consider the following issue: “does preventing any data collection of demographic information avoid the development of biased machine learning models?”. How do we test if the model is fair against different population groups (e.g. minorities) if we did not collect information that let us conduct such tests?</p>
<p>Sometimes it may be impossible to act according to some ethical values. For instance, you may want to buy a t-shirt manufactured under some specific conditions that you find ethical, but you may find none. Similarly, you may need your data to meet some conditions or requirements to avoid producing a biased output (such as a analysis or a ML model). But such data might not exist. Garcia et al. showcase an example of this issue in their work addressing public Covid-19 X-Ray datasets. The authors highlught that the most popular datasets were found at very high risk of inducing bias to models. Importantly, some solutions employed datasets containing adult individuals for the unhealthy group and a paediatric population as control group <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-santa2021public" role="doc-biblioref">Santa Cruz et al. 2021</a>)</span>. Such approach raises ethical concerns regarding the risk of harmful outcomes deriving from working with poor data. In this case, new data acquisition is needed to maintain data quality.</p>
<p>Preventing issues such as data drift and concept drift require constant monitoring of the models. Unsurprisingly, any intelligent entity interacting with a changing world requires frequent re-training and re-education. Any job requires a similar knowledge update process, from medical doctors to computer scientists or pilots. Such jobs require learning new diseases, treatments, regulations, protocols, devices, technologies, etc. Similarly, constant model evaluation is paramount to maintain the appropriate performance and fairness. Regulations and guidelines help to operate ethical considerations. For instance, the recent document “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI” published by the “high-level expert group on artificial intelligence” group from the European Commission presents transparency as a requirement for trustworthy AI. This document recommends transparency of all elements relevant to an AI system: the data, the system and the business models <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ai2019high" role="doc-biblioref">AI 2019</a>)</span>. Abiding to this requirement entails designing solutions with traceability and explainability in mind (among other features) so that models can be properly audited and their decisions thoroughly traced.</p>
<p>Other actions that may help to prevent bias and/or external validation issues include accompanying the data with metadata describing acquisition details, causal models describing the assumptions taken during the design stages, and documentation, among others <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-garcia2021need" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia, Vega, and Hertel 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In many product design (and other) endeavors, there often comes a moment when the question is asked, “Are we doing the right thing?” or “Is this the right solution?” In this context, the word right can mean many things. It can mean: Are we meeting the customer’s expectations? Is the design solution appropriate to the problem? Are we honoring the scope of the work? Is this a profitable feature to add to our product? Will people buy this? It can also mean: Do we agree that this action is acceptable to perform based on our values?” — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-davis2012ethics" role="doc-biblioref">Davis 2012</a>)</span></p>

<p>We often face situations where we care about the privacy of our data, e.g., we do not want our location to be shared with certain companies, but we wish to benefit from the same data to see if the road is jammed on our way to work. Similarly, we want our medical records to remain private but also wish to benefit from the analysis of medical records to improve the care and treatment that we receive. Moreover, we aim to automate and ease decisions thanks to data-driven algorithms but we also worry about unintended bias. Getting to know the consequences of our actions make us aware of what is right or wrong. Without that, we lack any motivation to fix potential problems. Data science is a new field and we are still defining what is right and wrong. We are starting to experience certain consequences regarding privacy, fairness, equity, etc. In this sense, a social consensus is growing, with laws and regulations enacted to enforce such values.</p>

<p>It is important not to confuse data ethics with computer ethics and information ethics. In the mid 1940s, developments in science and philosophy led to the creation of a new branch of ethics that would later be called “computer ethics” or “information ethics”. The founder of this new philosophical field was the American scholar Norbert Wiener, a professor of mathematics and engineering at MIT <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sep-ethics-computer" role="doc-biblioref">Bynum 2018</a>)</span>. Moreover, other terms such as “cyberethics” and “Internet ethics” have been used to refer to computer ethics issues associated with the Internet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Because of the breadth of Wiener’s concerns and the applicability of his ideas and methods to every kind of information technology, the term “information ethics” is an apt name for the new field of ethics that he founded. As a result, the term “computer ethics”, as it is typically used today, names only a subfield of Wiener’s much broader concerns.” — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sep-ethics-computer" role="doc-biblioref">Bynum 2018</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are variously termed “computer ethics”, “information ethics”, or “ICT ethics” (information and communication technology ethics). “Information ethics” is
perhaps the most appropriate name for Wiener’s field of ethical research, because it concerned all means of storing, transmitting and processing information, including, for example, perception, memory, printing, telephones, telegraph, recorders, phonographs, television, radio, computers, and so on. “Computer ethics” involves ethical questions and problems that are altered by the use of computers or that would not have existed if computers had not been invented.</p>
<p>Although these two branches of ethics are not handled in this course, they are tightly related to data ethics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data ethics builds on the foundation provided by computer and information ethics but, at the same time, it refines the approach endorsed so far in this research field, by shifting the level of abstraction of ethical enquiries, from being information-centric to being data-centric. This shift brings into focus the different moral dimensions of all kinds of data, even data that never translate directly into information but can be used to support actions or generate behaviours, for example. It highlights the need for ethical analyses to concentrate on the content and nature of computational operations—the interactions among hardware, software and data—rather than on the variety of digital technologies that enable them. — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-luciano2016data" role="doc-biblioref">Luciano and Mariarosaria 2016</a>)</span></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.2</span> What is data ethics?<a href="ethics-and-responsibility.html#what-is-data-ethics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As seen in the previous section, data ethics is tightly related to computer ethics and information ethics. Data ethics may be as well be found termed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data_ethics">big data ethics</a> which tackles data ownership, consent, privacy, and openness among other principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data ethics can be defined as the branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related to data (including generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination, sharing and use), algorithms (including artificial intelligence, artificial agents, machine learning and robots) and corresponding practices (including responsible innovation, programming, hacking and professional codes), in order to formulate and support morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right values). This means that the ethical challenges posed by data science can be mapped within the conceptual space delineated by three axes of research: the ethics of data, the ethics of algorithms and the ethics of practices. — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-luciano2016data" role="doc-biblioref">Luciano and Mariarosaria 2016</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, data ethics is a branch of ethics that tackles data practices involving the collection, generation, analysis and dissemination of data which have the potential to impact people and society. Data ethics provides guidelines regarding the concepts of right and wrong conduct within the scope of data management. <strong>All in all, data lies at the core of most solutions and research, serving as evidence of the studied phenomena and it is employed accordingly to draw conclusions about hypotheses and build theories.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whereas data is ethically neutral, the <em>use</em> of data is not</strong> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-davis2012ethics" role="doc-biblioref">Davis 2012</a>)</span>. The perception regarding a particular data practice, or in other words, the employment of data for a certain task, changes over time. What once was acceptable may become unnaceptable. A good example of this is the unsolicited email or SPAM. This was considered a great idea in the 1990s for marketing purposes. Overtime it became a problem and socially unacceptable. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003">Can’t SPAM act</a> was created to regulate this practice (e.g. offering a method to unsubscribe).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Organizations that fail to explicitly and transparently evaluate the ethical impacts of the data they collect from their customers risk diminishing the quality of their relationships with those customers, exposing their business to the risks of unintended consequences.” — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-davis2012ethics" role="doc-biblioref">Davis 2012</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For data science, data ethics asks questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I write the questions differently depending on the group of people they are addressed to?</li>
<li>Should I reject data if I suspect it to be falsified?</li>
<li>May I collect data from participants?</li>
<li>Which data should I collect exactly?</li>
<li>From what sample of people?</li>
</ul>

<p>Theranos’ goal was to quickly conduct several disease tests with a single drop of blood in a way that could be done at a fraction of the costs and with unrivalled ubiquity levering the spread of pharmacies and supermarkets.
Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh Balwani raised more than US$700 million through “elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance”, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission put it in March this year <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-topol2018blood" role="doc-biblioref">Topol 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Holmes studied chemical engineering at Stanford University in California but dropped out in her second year to start the company that later became Theranos.
The company’s board was crowded with political figures and relevant names. It included former secretaries of state George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, secretaries of defence, and former senators. It also managed to partner with companies such as the supermarket giant Safeway, and the pharmacy chain Walgreens. Channing Robertson, a professor of Holmes’s at Stanford, was also a board member and adviser to the company. She was praised by then-president Barack Obama and then-vice-president Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The main mistakes made by the company and its founders included a complete oversell of the product. The idea was of course great, but good ideas (or desires) are not enough. For instance, ot is rather easy to say “wouldn’t be nice to breath underwater with a cheap and light equipment that provided several days of autonomy?” or “wouldn’t be nice to produce energy at half the cost?”. Yes, it would be amazing. But the idea is not enough, we need to show <em>how</em> we reach the goal, idea or desire we propose. That is were the strength of the idea lies. Moreover, several investors made the mistake of not sufficiently check the technology readiness of Theranos. Hidden behind non-disclosure agreements and secrecy, Theranos managed to grow and escape inspections. The key difference with other technological start-ups is that healthcare related companies must undertake an even greater degree of quality control and validation, since lives may be at risk.</p>
<p>In particular, the solution of Theranos provided both false positives and false negatives, which put at risk the lives of many patients. In the end, Theranos required more than a single drop of blood to conduct the tests, but still less amount than the competition. However, the company diluted blood and ran the tests in machines from a different manufactured (hence not employing even their own product). Their accuracy numbers were forged by removing anomalous data points to increase the apparent performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] nearly 1 million lab tests had been run in California and Arizona. A significant proportion of these were erroneous; all had to be voided. An untold number of people were harmed by the erroneous results: some underwent unnecessary procedures, received misdiagnoses of serious conditions and experienced emotional turmoil. — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-topol2018blood" role="doc-biblioref">Topol 2018</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, a test for Lyme disease claimed a 97% “true positive rate” – a phrase with no clear public health meaning – but actually yielded mostly inaccurate results, according to a 2015 FDA review. A false positive for Lyme disease could mean unnecessary medications and a delayed diagnosis of true underlying conditions. — <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-theranos-faulty-blood-tests-got-to-market-and-what-that-shows-about-gaps-in-fda-regulation-168050">The Conversation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Netflix show, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/09/how-theranos-drama-the-dropout-gets-scam-and-tech-culture-right">The Dropout</a>, addresses the rise and fall of Theranos and its founder Elizabeth Holmes and provides some hints on the issues that led to the development of a scam that put the lives of real people at risk. The show is based on the podcast from <a href="https://abcaudio.com/podcasts/the-dropout/">ABC News of the same name</a>.</p>
<p>During the rise of Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes became famous and a symbol of enterprenaurship in the USA, with the technology and economic newspapers and magazines dedicating articles and covers to her. For instance, and article from Wired titled [This Woman Invented a Way to Run 30 Lab Tests on Only One Drop of Blood]](<a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/02/elizabeth-holmes-theranos/" class="uri">https://www.wired.com/2014/02/elizabeth-holmes-theranos/</a>). In 2015, she was appointed a member of the Harvard Medical School Board of Fellows and was named one of Time magazine’s “Time 100 most influential people”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On January 3, 2022, <strong>Holmes was found guilty on four counts of defrauding investors</strong> – three counts of wire fraud, and one of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She was found not guilty on four counts of defrauding patients – three counts of wire fraud and one of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The jury returned a “no verdict” on three counts of wire fraud against investors – the judge declared a mistrial on those counts and the government soon after agreed to dismiss them. Holmes is awaiting sentencing while remaining ‘at liberty’ on $500,000 bail, secured with property. <strong>She faces a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison, and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution</strong>, for each count of wire fraud and for each conspiracy count. The sentences would likely be served concurrently thus an effective maximum of 20 years total. Sentencing is scheduled for October 17, 2022. — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes#U.S._v._Holmes,_et_al.">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company and its founders broke several ethical principles and standards such as honesty, integrity, and credibility. False statements were provided to investors, employees, partners and customers (See more at <a href="https://sfmagazine.com/post-entry/june-2022-theranos-cautionary-tale-of-ethical-failings/">SF Magazine</a>). Many Medical Doctors worked at Theranos, and one of their principles from the medical Hippocratic Oath is: <em>primum non nocere</em>, i.e. <em>first do not to harm</em> (or “I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm”). Wrong methodologies were employed, poor methods were used, and finally, wrong results were knowingly introduced on purpose into the system, reaching real people and jeopardising their lives.</p>
