<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 5</span> Surrogates and Proxies<a href="surrogates-and-proxies.html#surrogates-and-proxies" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>During this course we may have seen the term surrogate and proxy many times in the context of particular examples. These terms can be used interchangeably. In general, surrogates and proxies are variables that can be measured and employed in place of some other variable that cannot be measured. This impediment may be related to legal, ethical restrictions or technical difficulties. Of course, the employment of such surrogate metric or variable depends upon the assumption that such relationship with the true variable holds for our purposes. For instance, it may not hold for the general population and just for the acquired sample, therefore this surrogate may present external validity issues.</p>
<p>The employment of surrogate metrics may seem attractive for certain purposes but is a source of problems when they are employed inadvertently when employing machine learning solutions or any other modelling approach.</p>
<p>For instance, the ZIP code is a widely accepted proxy that can often reveal race, ethnicity, or age. From an ethical point of view, such proxies can be employed for the good or the bad. In the United States of America, it is forbidden by law from considering race in admissions. However, consider that a campus may want to ensure certain diversity or lack of it. In Texas, the “Top 10 Percent Law” is the common name for the state law passed in 1997 that guarantees Texas students who graduated in the top ten percent of their high school class automatic admission to all state-funded universities. The goal was to find a way to increase the enrollment of black and Latino students after a federal court banned race-based affirmative action in the state. Without entering into the fairness and impact of the law, which is still open to debate, it is clear that in scenarios where most high schools have a majority of a certain race, such a race will be favoured over the rest. Therefore, such rules may have a racial or discriminatory impact on university admissions. However, in this case, there may be other factors in place, since being granted access does not mean that you can, for instance, assume the costs of university tuition and so on.</p>
<p>Similarly, say lenders would like to exclude borrowers of certain race. Despite the law prohibiting from doing this, the lenders could find a proxy or surrogate such as neighborhood to continue excluding by race by benefiting from knowing that certain districts or areas are populated by racialised citizens.</p>
<p>Importantly, should the underlying association change, the proxy or surragate would have to be re-calibrated.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Confounding factors<a href="surrogates-and-proxies.html#confounding-factors" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Related to this, we can find confounding variables. Confounders (see age in Fig. <a href="surrogates-and-proxies.html#fig:cibb-confounding">5.1</a>) are variables that affect both the potential predictor variable (physical activity) and the outcome (cardiac problems). When the presence of confounders is unknown and in lack of experiments specifically designed to minimise them (e.g., randomised controlled trials), we cannot control for them. Uncontrolled confounders lead to conclude that a given feature may be a strong predictor of the outcome when in reality the association is spurious <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-garcia2021need" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia, Vega, and Hertel 2022</a>)</span>. Importantly, such associations may not hold anymore when the sample comes from a different setting where the confounder is differently expressed, e.g. income level may play a different role on diabetes treatment depending on the country.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Data alone is not enough<a href="surrogates-and-proxies.html#data-is-not-enough" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The confirmation of a hypothesis is often considered to increase as the number of favourable test findings grows, but the increase in confirmation, produced by one new favourable instance, will generally become smaller as the number of previously established favourable instances grows <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hempel-pos" role="doc-biblioref">Hempel 1966</a>)</span>. Many researchers and data scientists blindly rely on the dogma <em>the more data, the merrier</em> but the addition of one more favourable finding raises the hypothesis confirmation but little. The confirmation of a hypothesis depends not only on the quantity of the favourable evidence available but also on its variety.</p>
<p>As we have seen during this course, data alone is not enough. Note that this is especially a problem for solutions based on Machine Learning, since domain knowledge or <em>context</em> should be introduced somehow to <em>direct</em> the model in the desired direction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is no learning without bias, there is no learning without knowledge” — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-skansi2020guide" role="doc-biblioref">Skansi 2020</a>)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-domingos2015master" role="doc-biblioref">Domingos 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A relevant example on how data depends on its context is user ratings or opinions. For instance, the meaning of <em>fashionable clothes</em> changes over time, as do political terms. This issue is known as <em>concept drift</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kubat2017introduction" role="doc-biblioref">Kubat 2017</a>)</span>. Similarly, a text-mining engine to tag biology terms with the corresponding ontology terms may confuse elements between species, as several entities appear in multiple animals or organisms. Context is crucial for external validation and translation of solutions into real-world settings. A system for clothes recommendation should adapt to countries, cultures or ages. Similarly, a health system to predict patient risk based on disease comorbidities must be <em>calibrated</em> for each country or region (e.g. Diabetes treatment is often affordable in the EU, but an expensive treatment in the USA, which increases its mortality rate).</p>

</div>
<p>Figure <a href="surrogates-and-proxies.html#fig:inference-engine">5.2</a> represents an ideal causal inference engine for scientific questions. Today, causal models for scientific applications are based on a similar design. It is important to notice how this diagram showcases the importance of extra-observational information (i.e. information other than data) such as <strong>assumptions</strong>, which derive from the available <strong>knowledge</strong>. With them, a <strong>causal model</strong> is built in any of its different forms, e.g. logical statements, structural equations, causal diagrams, etc. Causation (or a causation assumption) can be defined from the following analogy, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a cause of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> <em>listens</em> to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and determines its value in response to what it hears. For instance, the patient’s lifespan <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is determined by the intake of drug <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> acts as a cause of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> (although it might not be the only cause), which is represented by an arrow from <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> in a causal diagram (see Figure <a href="surrogates-and-proxies.html#fig:blueprint">5.3</a>). For the sake of simplicity the other causes of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> can be grouped in an additional variable <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>In box <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> the patterns encoded in the paths of the causal model yield a series of observable consequences (or data dependencies), that we know as <strong>testable implications</strong> (remember the hypothetico-deductive method?). These implications can be used to test the model. For instance, the lack of path between <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> would imply that <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> are independent, meaning that a variation of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> will not alter <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. If such implication is contradicted by the data, the model should be revised bearing in mind this new knowledge. The box <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> is in charge of the scientific <strong>query</strong> which must be encoded in causal vocabulary, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(P(L | do(D))\)</span>, i.e. what is the probability that a typical patient would live <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> years given that it takes the drug <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>?.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:blueprint"></span>
<img src="Figures/blueprint.png" alt="Diagram depicting two different scenarios: before, and after an intervention." width="70%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.3: Diagram depicting two different scenarios: before, and after an intervention.
</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(do()\)</span> operator represents an intervention in the system, in contrast to an observation <span class="math inline">\(P(L|D)\)</span>. An instance of the latter would entail letting the patient decide between taking or not the drug (see left side of Figure <a href="surrogates-and-proxies.html#fig:blueprint">5.3</a>). Such decision might be affected by other variables we are not aware, like the patient’s education, family, etc. However, when we make an intervention and assume that we are giving the drug to the patient, the arrow illustrating the patient’s decision disappears (right side of Figure <a href="surrogates-and-proxies.html#fig:blueprint">5.3</a>).</p>
<p>The <strong><em>estimand</em></strong> is the recipe to answer the scientific query, written as a probability formula, such as <span class="math inline">\(P(L | D, Z) \times P(Z)\)</span>. Once the <strong>data</strong> is introduced, an <strong>estimate</strong> can be calculated. Importantly, some queries may not be answerable regardless of the amount of data collected. For instance, our causal model could indicate that both <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> depend upon a third variable <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. If there would not be any way to measure <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, the query <span class="math inline">\(P(L | do(D))\)</span> would be unanswerable. Collecting data for this question would be worthless. Under such a scenario, the causal model needs to be reviewed. Either to introduce new knowledge to enable estimating <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, or to simplify the previous assumptions, potentially increasing the risk of wrong answers, e.g. stating that <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> has a negligible effect on <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</p>
<p>Following the analogy, the data acts as the ingredients of the recipe provided by the <em>estimand</em>. Our estimate (box <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>) represents an approximate answer to the query. Such an answer is approximate because data always represents a finite sample from a theoretically infinite population <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-book-of-why" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl and Mackenzie 2018</a>)</span>. An example of answer in this case could be that drug <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> increases lifespan <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> of diabetic patients by <span class="math inline">\(30\% \pm 10\%\)</span>.</p>
<p>The most important fact about the diagram in Figure <a href="surrogates-and-proxies.html#fig:inference-engine">5.2</a> is that data and causal model are two independent pieces of the puzzle that later work together. Data is collected after the causal model and stating that the scientific query can be answered. The <em>estimand</em> computation does not require any data. Comparing this to conventional machine learning (ML) systems, a ML solution would have to be re-trained when moved from one hospital to another since such model just fitted a function to data, without levering from any causal model.</p>

<div class="rnote">
<p><em>There are three kinds of lies: Lies, damned lies, and statistics</em></p>
</div>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.covid-datascience.com/post/israeli-data-how-can-efficacy-vs-severe-disease-be-strong-when-60-of-hospitalized-are-vaccinated">blog post</a>, biostatistics Professor Jeffrey Morris demonstrates how without properly controlling for age, efficacy against severe disease in Israel may appear weak when in fact within each age-group it is extremely strong. Consider the table from Figure <a href="surrogates-and-proxies.html#fig:vaccine-rates-a">5.4</a> and the following data from the the Israeli government. As of August 15, 2021 nearly 60% of all patients currently hospitalized for COVID-19 are vaccinated. Out of 515 patients currently hospitalized with severe cases in Israel, 301 (58.4%) of these cases were fully vaccinated.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 5.4: Misleading table. This kind of tables have been used to claim that vaccines do not work or that its efectiveness reduces over time.
</p>
</div>
<p>The numbers are true, but we need more than that to draw a proper conclusion about vaccine efficacy. Consider the following extreme scenarios. If the number of vaccinated people would be 0 we would expect all severe cases to be not vaccinated (obviously). On the other hand, if 100% of people would have been vaccinated, we would expect all severe cases to proceed from vaccinated people and 0 from non vaccinated. In this case, we have an in-between situation where 80% of residents (older than 12 years) have been vaccinated. Therefore, since the group of vaccinated people is larger than the non-vaccinated, we can expect more severe cases in absolute numbers. However, once we adjust for vaccination rates and normalise the counts, the story changes. The rate of severe cases is three times higher in unvaccinated individuals.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:vaccine-rates-b"></span>
<img src="Figures/vaccines-ex-fig2.png" alt="Table adjusted for vaccination rates." width="70%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.5: Table adjusted for vaccination rates.
</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Vaccine Efficacy vs. Severe disease = 1 - 5.3/16.4 = 67.5%.
The interpretation of this number is that the vaccines are preventing &gt;2/3 of the serious infections leading to hospitalization that would have occurred sans vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, the obtained efficacy is lower than what we would expect. There are other factors that contribute to this confusion, including: age disparity in vaccinations, old people is more likely to be hospitalized than young people, etc.</p>
<p>I recommend going through the blog post to see how the author continues to apply adjustments and stratifications to find the true efficacy of the vaccines. Moreover, this is a good example of the Simpson’s paradox, where misleading results can be obtained in the presence of confounding factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, as long as there is a major age disparity in vaccination rates, with older individuals being more highly vaccinated, then the fact that older people have an inherently higher risk of hospitalization when infected with a respiratory virus means that it is always important to stratify results by age; Even more fundamentally, it is important to use infection and disease rates (per 100k, e.g.) and not raw counts to compare unvaccinated and vaccinated groups to adjust for the proportion vaccinated. Use of raw counts exaggerates the vaccine efficacy when vaccinated proportion is low and attenuates the vaccine efficacy when, like in Israel, vaccines proportions are high.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/29/opinion/hurricane-dorian-forecast-map.html">following article</a> by Alberto Cairo published in The New York Times explains how hurricane cone forecast maps can mislead the public and produce real-world consequences.</p>

Others think it shows areas under threat. Recent <a href="https://interactive.miami.edu/hurakan/">research</a> suggests that 40% of people would not feel threatened if they lived just outside of the cone. Moreover, people who live inside the cone, but far from the center, take less precautions than those closer to the central line. These misunderstandings have real-world consequences. Actually, the cone represents a range of possible positions and paths for the storm’s center. The dots in the middle of the cone correspond to the forecast of where the hurricane’s center could be in the following five days. But there’s a good chance that the actual center of the storm will not end up being at those positions.</p>
<p>To create the cone, the National Hurricane Center (N.H.C.) surrounds each estimated position of the storm center with circles of increasing size. <strong>These circles represent uncertainty</strong>, meaning that the storm center may end up being anywhere inside the circles — or even outside of them. The uncertainty circles grow over time because it is more difficult to to predict what will happen in five days from now than in one day. Finally, a curve connects the circles, resulting in what is popularly known as the ‘cone of uncertainty’.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>N.H.C. says cones will contain the path of the storm center only 60 to 70 % of the time. In other words, one out of three times we experience a storm like this, its center will be outside the boundaries of the cone. Hurricanes are also hundreds of miles wide, and the cone shows only the possible path of the storm’s center. Heavy rain, storm surges, flooding, wind and other hazards may affect areas outside the cone. The cone, when presented on its own, doesn’t give us much information about a hurricane’s dangers. The N.H.C. designs other graphics, including this one showing areas that may be affected by strong winds. But these don’t receive nearly as much attention as the cone. The cone graphic is deceptively simple. That becomes a liability if people believe they’re out of harm’s way when they aren’t. As with many charts, it’s risky to assume we can interpret a hurricane map correctly with just a glance. Graphics like these need to be read closely and carefully. Only then can we grasp what they’re really saying.</p>

Rachel Thomas --- Co-founder of fast.ai. Thomas was selected by Forbes magazine as one of the 20 most incredible women in artificial intelligence.
Thomas is concerned about the lack of diversity in AI, and believes that there are a lot of qualified people out there who are not getting hired. She has particularly focused on the problem of poor retention of women in tech, noting that "41% of women working in tech leave within 10 years. That's over twice the attrition rate for men. And those with advanced degrees, who presumably have more options, are 176% more likely to leave." Thomas believes AI's "cool and exclusive aura" needs to be broken in order to unlock it for outsiders, and to make it accessible to those with non-traditional and non-elite backgrounds.
