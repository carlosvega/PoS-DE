<div id="experimental-control" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Experimental Control</h2>
<p>Experimental control entails a series of procedures for experiment and observation design aimed at minimising the effects of extraneous variables (i.e. confounding factors) other than the manipulated variables (i.e. independent variable) to ensure that the measured variable (i.e. dependent variable) is only affected by the independent variables. To evaluate the effects of manipulating the independent variables, some control system is needed in which no such deliberate changes are introduced. As we have seen, sampling units (e.g. study participants) are often divided into two groups (the experimental group and the control group) in a way that the only noticeable (or significant) difference between them lies in the stimuli exerted by the experiment.
Therefore, the control and experimental groups must be <em>homogeneous</em> in all relevant factors.</p>
<p>In general, there are two techniques for the formation of such homogeneous groups: individual and collective control <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bunge2017philosophy" role="doc-biblioref">Bunge 2017</a>)</span>. <strong>Individual control</strong> requires simultaneous pairing of individuals in both groups, i.e. every member of the experimental group has a corresponding equivalent member in the control group. For instance, for every thirty years old Asian man in the control group another thirty years old Asian man is assigned to the experimental group. Simultaneous pairing is complex and expensive. <strong>Statistical control</strong> has two main types. On one side, the <em>control of distributions</em> should be performed to equate certain parameters such as averages, spreads (i.e. std. dev.) and other collective properties (e.g. medians). This technique is more flexible as only some properties are kept under control. In this case, we would take two samples of people with the same age and height distributions. Both simultaneous pairing and distribution control share a common disadvantage regarding the formation of the groups, which could be unintentionally biased. For instance, we could assign the strongest people to the treatment (or experimental) group to make sure they bear the treatment. To prevent this issue the two groups are usually formed at random. Thanks to <strong>randomisation</strong>, all variables (including most unknown factors) that were not previously controlled become randomly distributed, minimising their effect on the dependent variables. However, randomisation is not an alternative to other techniques, but rather a complement.</p>
<div id="other-experimental-control-techniques" class="section level3" number="4.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Other experimental control techniques</h3>
<p>There are multiple strategies for experimental control. We have previously seen the method of division into treatment and control groups. The control and treatment groups can entail two moments in <strong>time</strong>, with the initial setting being the control scenario which is later on manipulated through the intervention of certain variables (e.g. measure noise from bats in a dark chamber before and after turning a light). Another technique requires <strong>holding certain factors constant</strong> or finding scenarios (like in a field experiment) with the same background conditions. Nonetheless, constructing such conditions in a laboratory can also achieve this goal. In an <strong>elimination</strong> strategy some factors are removed to simplify study conditions, such as air resistance in a vacuum chamber or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_tube">drop tower</a>, radio waves in a Faraday cage, or gravity in space experiments. A common case of elimination is <strong>blinding</strong>, where subjects do not know which group they are assigned to (single blinding). Moreover, double-blinding implies hiding this information from the experimenter and/or the data analyst. Finally, we can <strong>separate factors</strong> by measuring their effect and correcting for it. For example, the measurements of time dilation require taking into account the Doppler effect caused by the changing distance between the observer and the moving clock. GPS systems perform adjustments due to the effects of time dilation and gravitational frequency shifts. Another example, missile trajectories are often adjusted for the effect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force">Coriolis force</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Randomised Control Trials</h2>
<p>Randomisation offers a systematic solution for the division of participants (or sampling units) into two groups. In particular, RCTs are frequently regarded as a gold standard for clinical trials and among the highest quality evidence available (see Figure <a href="stats-abuse.html#fig:pyramid-eviodence">4.1</a>). However, as with every method, it will only yield fruitful results if applied correctly, and its sole employment does not warrant against other errors.</p>
<p>There are different types of randomisation. In <strong>simple randomisation</strong>, subjects are assigned into two groups purely randomly but in small samples, we risk creating uneven groups. <strong>Block randomisation</strong> works by randomising participants within blocks such that an equal number are assigned to each treatment. For example, given a block size of 4, there are 6 possible ways to equally assign participants to a block (AABB, ABAB, ABBA, BAAB, BABA, BBAA). Allocation proceeds by randomly selecting one of the orderings and assigning the next block of participants to study groups according to the specified sequence. A major disadvantage of this method is that it might be possible to predict the next sequence. <strong>Stratified randomisation</strong> is crucial whenever all other properties (except for the factors of interest) need to be assigned equally. The study population is first stratified into subgroups (i.e. <em>stratas</em>) sharing attributes, then followed by simple or block random sampling from the subgroups.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of RCTs is the reduction of selection bias or allocation bias. In Chapter <a href="stats-abuse.html#stats-abuse">4</a> we will see biases in more detail. The randomisation process reduces mistrust towards a potential rigged distribution of the participants. Another common advantage is that it facilitates blinding the groups from investigators and participants.</p>
<div class="tipbox">

<p><strong>Terminology Note:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Very often terms are used interchangeably in many domain but they can also mean different things depending on the are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By “allocation bias” we understand the bias caused by allocating patients with better prognosis to either the experimental or the control group. In the context of a randomized trial the term “selection bias” is sometimes used instead of allocation bias to indicate selection of patients into treatment arms. We avoid the term “selection bias” as it has a different meaning in epidemiology more broadly: selection of non-representative persons into a study. — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-paludan2016mechanisms" role="doc-biblioref">Paludan-Müller, Laursen, and Hróbjartsson 2016</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>However, RCTs do not necessarily ensure that background factors are equally distributed in the treatment and control groups. For small samples randomisation can provide unequal distributions. The average number after rolling a dice an infinite amount of times will converge to 3.5, but we should not be surprised if we roll a dice 10 or 20 times obtaining considerably more occurrences of the number 6 than the other numbers. The danger of relying on pure randomisation to balance covariates has been described in <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-krause2003random" role="doc-biblioref">Krause and Howard 2003</a>)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-morgan2012rerandomization" role="doc-biblioref">Morgan and Rubin 2012</a>)</span>. For this reason is essential to check for imbalances in known factors after randomisation. Stratified randomisation also helps balancing known factors. Nonetheless, randomisation does not necessarily guarantee full control of unknown factors but <em>on average</em> their effect should be significantly smaller than the treatment applied <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-deaton2018understanding" role="doc-biblioref">Deaton and Cartwright 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Although RCTs are still preferred to observational studies, there are scenarios in which intervention is not possible. For instance, we cannot assign participants to be obese or not in order to study the effect of obesity on heart diseases.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Origins of RCTs</h3>
<p>R.A. Fisher (1890-1962) conceived the RCTs in the 1930s. Fisher designed intricate approaches to disentangle the effects of fertiliser from other variables. Using the <em>Latin square</em>, he would divide the field into a grid of subplots to test each fertiliser with each combination of soil type and plant. However, in this scenario the experimenter would observe the effects of the fertiliser <em>mixed</em> (i.e. <em>confounded</em>) with a variety of other things (e.g. soil fertility, drainage, microflora). Fischer realised that the only design that would “<em>trick nature</em>” is one where the fertilisers are assigned randomly to the subplots. Of course, sometimes you might be unlucky and assign a certain fertiliser to the least fertile subplots, but other times you might get the opposite assignment. A new random allocation is generated each time the experiment is conducted. By running the experiment multiple times the luck of each fertiliser is <em>averaged</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Fisher realized that an uncertain answer to the right question is much better than a highly certain answer to the wrong question. […] If you ask the right question, getting an answer that is occasionally wrong is much less of a problem. You can still estimate the amount of uncertainty in your answer, because the uncertainty comes from the randomization procedure (which is known) rather than the characteristics of the soil (which are unknown). — Section “Why RCTs work” in Chapter 4 from <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-book-of-why" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl and Mackenzie 2018</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Book of Why describes the aforementioned experiment in causal terms <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-book-of-why" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl and Mackenzie 2018</a>)</span>. The causal diagram from Figure <a href="stats-abuse.html#fig:rct-diagram">4.2</a> depicts a model describing how the yield of each plot is determined by both the fertiliser and other variables, but the effect of the fertiliser is also affected by the same variables (red arrows). The experimenter aims to know about the effect of the fertiliser controlling for the latter effects. In other words, a model in which the effects represented by the red arrows are controlled. In this second scenario, the relation between Fertilizer and Yield is <em>unconfounded</em> since there is no common cause of Fertiliser and Yield.</p>

<p>Transferring RCTs results to other scenarios is not trivial. All in all, RCTs results concern a particular sample used during the study. The study sample is of course drawn from a larger group, i.e. the population, but the RCT results cannot be simply applied to another sample drawn from the population. Randomisation is not the same as random sampling from the population. In fact, there are many RCT studies that misrepresented certain population groups. An example of women inclusion issues in clinical studies includes the under-representation of women in stroke randomized controlled trials, which leads to misleading conclusions that affect stroke care delivery <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsivgoulis2017under" role="doc-biblioref">Tsivgoulis, Katsanos, and Caso 2017</a>)</span>. A similar bias exists in animal research, including <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/07/science-huge-diversity-problem-lab-rats/">lab mice</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most rodents used in biomedical studies — the ones that suss out the effects of treatments before they make it to humans — have boy parts and boy biological functions. And that particular kind of gender imbalance has cascading effects. A growing body of evidence indicates that females process pain differently than males. But many lab scientists who study ways of treating pain <em>still </em>use all-male cohorts of lab mice. They say it’s because male mice and rats aren’t as hormonal as females—because isn’t that what they always say—and are therefore more reliable in terms of getting data. And that means the scientific community is ignoring research that might help women manage pain better. — <strong>Science Has a Huge Diversity Problem… in Lab Mice - Wired</strong></p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Of 2,347 articles reviewed, 618 included animals and/or cells. For animal research, 22% of the publications did not specify the sex of the animals. Of the reports that did specify the sex, 80% of publications included only males, 17% only females, and 3% both sexes. A greater disparity existed in the number of animals studied: 16,152 (84%) male and 3,173 (16%) female. — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-yoon2014sex" role="doc-biblioref">Yoon et al. 2014</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, RCTs must be internally valid, — i.e. the design must eliminate the possibility of bias — but to be clinically useful the result must also be relevant to a well-defined group of patients (i.e. external validity). Differences between trial protocol and routine practice also affect the external validity of RCTs.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Cross-validation in Machine Learning</h2>
<p>As data scientists, you may wonder why the previous practices are relevant to your job. In this section I want to show how similar control measures must be considered regarding machine learning (ML). When applying supervised ML methods, is important to prevent over-fitting and under-fitting situations. In particular, over-fitting occurs when a model begins to <em>memorize</em> training data rather than <em>learning</em> to generalize from a trend (see Figure <a href="stats-abuse.html#fig:overfitting">4.3</a>). One of the techniques to detect or lessen the change of over-fitting includes cross-validation. The basis of this technique is to test the generalization power of the model by evaluating its performance on a set of data not used during the training stage.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The simplest approach is the <strong>hold out method</strong> which entails spliting the dataset into a train and test sets. However, yet another part of the dataset is often held out (validation set) so that the model training proceeds on the training set, the model evaluation on the validation set, and once the hyperparameters are successfully tweaked, the final evaluation is conducted on the test set. This process reduces the amount of data available for training. Cross-validation (CV) alleviates this issue.</p>
<p>The following procedure (see Figure <a href="stats-abuse.html#fig:cross-validation">4.4</a>) is followed for each of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> “folds”:</p>
<ul>
<li>A model is trained using <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> of the folds as training data.</li>
<li>The resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The performance measure reported by K-fold CV is then the average of the values computed in the loop. This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-scikit-learn" role="doc-biblioref">Pedregosa et al. 2011</a>)</span>.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:cross-validation"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>However, the vanilla approach to K-fold CV does not consider certain properties of the dataset. In particular, K-fold CV is not affected by classes or groups. For instance, the training set of the first CV iteration in Figure <a href="stats-abuse.html#fig:k-fold-vis">4.5</a> does not contain one of the classes.</p>

</div>
<p>Issues similar to the ones previously studied regarding RCTs can arise when conducting cross-validation. Some problems exhibit a large imbalance in the distribution of the target classes. For example, the negative class can be more representative than the positive class. In such cases, stratified sampling is recommended (see Figure <a href="stats-abuse.html#fig:k-fold-strategies">4.6</a>) to preserve relative class frequencies in each train and validation fold.</p>
<p>One strong assumption of machine learning theory is that data is Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.), i.e. that all samples stem from the same generative process and that such process is assumed to have no memory regarding past samples. For example, a succession of throws of a fair coin is i.i.d. since the coin has no memory, so all the throws are independent. In this sense, if we know that the generative process has a group structure (e.g. samples collected from different subjects, experiments, measurement devices) we should use group-wise CV. The grouping of data depends on the context. For instance, in medical data, we can find multiple samples for each patient, so it makes sense to group the samples by patient to prevent any <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/0.24/common_pitfalls.html#data-leakage"><em>data leakage</em></a>. Similarly, problems where the samples have been generated using a time-dependent process call for <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#timeseries-cv">time-series aware CV schemes</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Similar to RTC internal validity, cross-validation does not ensure transferability to other scenarios. External validation must be performed with independent datasets to ensure robustness against new scenarios. Consider a deep-learning algorithm trained to predict the number of years a patient will survive based on its characteristics and the medication administrated. This system could be then transferred to a different hospital, in another country, region, or city where the population characteristics (diet, hygiene, professions) are different. The model will require undertaking a certain recalibration process to learn the new conditions.</p>

<div id="data-is-not-enough" class="section level2" number="4.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Data alone is not enough</h2>
<p>The confirmation of a hypothesis is often considered to increase as the number of favourable test findings grows, but the increase in confirmation, produced by one new favourable instance, will generally become smaller as the number of previously established favourable instances grows <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hempel-pos" role="doc-biblioref">Hempel 1966</a>)</span>. Many researchers and data scientists blindly rely on the dogma <em>the more data, the merrier</em> but the addition of one more favourable finding raises the hypothesis confirmation but little. The confirmation of a hypothesis depends not only on the quantity of the favourable evidence available but also on its variety.</p>
<div class="tipbox">
<div data-latex="">
<p><strong>Note for data scientists!</strong></p>
</div>
<p>As he have seen, data alone is not enough. Note that this is a problem for solutions based on Machine Learning, since domain knowledge or <em>context</em> should be introduced somehow to <em>direct</em> the model in the desired direction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is no learning without bias, there is no learning without knowledge” — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-skansi2020guide" role="doc-biblioref">Skansi 2020</a>)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-domingos2015master" role="doc-biblioref">Domingos 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of how data depends on its context is user ratings or opinions. For instance, the meaning of <em>fashionable clothes</em> changes over time, as do political terms. This issue is known as <em>concept drift</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kubat2017introduction" role="doc-biblioref">Kubat 2017</a>)</span>. Similarly, a text-mining engine to tag biology terms with the corresponding ontology terms may confuse elements between species, as several entities appear in multiple animals or organisms.</p>
<p>Finally, context is crucial for external validation and translation of solutions into real-world settings. A system for clothes recommendation should adapt to countries, cultures or ages. Similarly, a health system to predict patient risk based on disease comorbidities must be <em>calibrated</em> for each country or region (e.g. Diabetes treatment is often affordable in the EU, but an expensive treatment in the USA, which increases its mortality rate).</p>

<div class="rnote">
<p><em>There are three kinds of lies: Lies, damned lies, and statistics</em></p>
</div>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.covid-datascience.com/post/israeli-data-how-can-efficacy-vs-severe-disease-be-strong-when-60-of-hospitalized-are-vaccinated">blog post</a>, biostatistics Professor Jeffrey Morris demonstrates how without properly controlling for age, efficacy against severe disease in Israel may appear weak when in fact within each age-group it is extremely strong. Consider the table from Figure <a href="stats-abuse.html#fig:vaccine-rates-a">4.7</a> and the following data from the the Israeli government. As of August 15, 2021 nearly 60% of all patients currently hospitalized for COVID-19 are vaccinated. Out of 515 patients currently hospitalized with severe cases in Israel, 301 (58.4%) of these cases were fully vaccinated.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The numbers are true, but we need more than that to draw a proper conclusion about vaccine efficacy. Consider the following extreme scenarios. If the number of vaccinated people would be 0 we would expect all severe cases to be not vaccinated (obviously). On the other hand, if 100% of people would have been vaccinated, we would expect all severe cases to proceed from vaccinated people and 0 from non vaccinated. In this case, we have an in-between situation where 80% of residents (older than 12 years) have been vaccinated. Therefore, since the group of vaccinated people is larger than the non-vaccinated, we can expect more severe cases in absolute numbers. However, once we adjust for vaccination rates and normalise the counts, the story changes. The rate of severe cases is three times higher in unvaccinated individuals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vaccine Efficacy vs. Severe disease = 1 - 5.3/16.4 = 67.5%.
The interpretation of this number is that the vaccines are preventing &gt;2/3 of the serious infections leading to hospitalization that would have occurred sans vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, the obtained efficacy is lower than what we would expect. There are other factors that contribute to this confusion, including: age disparity in vaccinations, old people is more likely to be hospitalized than young people, etc.</p>
<p>I recommend going through the blog post to see how the author continues to apply adjustments and stratifications to find the true efficacy of the vaccines. Moreover, this is a good example of the Simpson’s paradox, where misleading results can be obtained in the presence of confounding factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, as long as there is a major age disparity in vaccination rates, with older individuals being more highly vaccinated, then the fact that older people have an inherently higher risk of hospitalization when infected with a respiratory virus means that it is always important to stratify results by age; Even more fundamentally, it is important to use infection and disease rates (per 100k, e.g.) and not raw counts to compare unvaccinated and vaccinated groups to adjust for the proportion vaccinated. Use of raw counts exaggerates the vaccine efficacy when vaccinated proportion is low and attenuates the vaccine efficacy when, like in Israel, vaccines proportions are high.</p>

Others think it shows areas under threat. Recent <a href="https://interactive.miami.edu/hurakan/">research</a> suggests that 40% of people would not feel threatened if they lived just outside of the cone. Moreover, people who live inside the cone, but far from the center, take less precautions than those closer to the central line. These misunderstandings have real-world consequences. Actually, the cone represents a range of possible positions and paths for the storm’s center. The dots in the middle of the cone correspond to the forecast of where the hurricane’s center could be in the following five days. But there’s a good chance that the actual center of the storm will not end up being at those positions.</p>
<p>To create the cone, the National Hurricane Center (N.H.C.) surrounds each estimated position of the storm center with circles of increasing size. <strong>These circles represent uncertainty</strong>, meaning that the storm center may end up being anywhere inside the circles — or even outside of them. The uncertainty circles grow over time because it is more difficult to to predict what will happen in five days from now than in one day. Finally, a curve connects the circles, resulting in what is popularly known as the ‘cone of uncertainty’.</p>

<p>N.H.C. says cones will contain the path of the storm center only 60 to 70 % of the time. In other words, one out of three times we experience a storm like this, its center will be outside the boundaries of the cone. Hurricanes are also hundreds of miles wide, and the cone shows only the possible path of the storm’s center. Heavy rain, storm surges, flooding, wind and other hazards may affect areas outside the cone. The cone, when presented on its own, doesn’t give us much information about a hurricane’s dangers. The N.H.C. designs other graphics, including this one showing areas that may be affected by strong winds. But these don’t receive nearly as much attention as the cone. The cone graphic is deceptively simple. That becomes a liability if people believe they’re out of harm’s way when they aren’t. As with many charts, it’s risky to assume we can interpret a hurricane map correctly with just a glance. Graphics like these need to be read closely and carefully. Only then can we grasp what they’re really saying.</p>
